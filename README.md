<h2>TC Advanced Computer Science AB :coffee:</h2>
This is my repository for everything in my TC Advanced Computer Science course as a Junior in high school and an aspiring computer scientist at J.A. Craig High, Janesville, WI 53545.  While what I'm taking is TC Advanced Computer Science AB through Craig, it's actually UW-Whitewater's CompSci 220 course taken through our P.I.E. (Partners in Education) program.

  <h4><b>This repository contains all of the following for this course:</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Projects and Practice Programs.</li>
  <li>Templates and Demonstrations of various Data Structures learned in the course.</li>
  <li>New and noteworthy things put into practice with code.</li>
</ul>

Of note: All programs and projects are made in IntelliJ Ultimate from JetBrains using an educational license.
